If you wish to allow the guest user to connect from a remote host, you should set the loopback_users configuration item to []. 
A complete </etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.config> which does this would look like:

[{rabbit, [{loopback_users, []}]}].

invoke-rc.d rabbitmq-server stop
invoke-rc.d rabbitmq-server start
rabbitmqctl status
